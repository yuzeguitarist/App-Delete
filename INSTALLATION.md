## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Command not found" when running `swift`

**Solution:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Or install full Xcode from the Mac App Store.

### Issue: Build fails with "No such module"

**Solution:** Ensure you're using Swift 5.9 or later

```bash
swift --version
```

If version is too old, update Xcode or Swift toolchain.

### Issue: App crashes on launch

**Possible Causes:**
- Full Disk Access not granted
- Corrupted build
- macOS version too old

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Full Disk Access is enabled
2. Clean build:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .build
   swift build -c release
   ```
3. Check macOS version:
   ```bash
   sw_vers
   ```
   Must be 13.0+

### Issue: Permission denied errors

**Solution:** Grant Full Disk Access (see setup steps above)

### Issue: Can't find .build directory

**Cause:** Haven't built the project yet

**Solution:**
```bash
swift build -c release
```

### Issue: App won't quit

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force quit
killall DeepUninstaller

# Or use Activity Monitor
# Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Activity Monitor
# Find DeepUninstaller ‚Üí Quit Process
```

- macOS VMs in VMware Fusion or Parallels
- GitHub Actions with macOS runners

---

## Continuous Integration

For automated builds in CI/CD:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
- name: Build
  run: swift build -c release

- name: Test (when available)
  run: swift test
```

See [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) for full configuration.
