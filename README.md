# Deep Uninstaller for macOS

A powerful macOS application that uses active file system monitoring to ensure complete removal of applications and their associated files.

## Overview

Unlike traditional uninstaller tools that rely on passive scanning and predefined rules, Deep Uninstaller actively monitors your file system in real-time to track exactly what files an application creates. This approach is particularly effective for:

- Cross-platform applications (Electron, Linux ports)
- Apps that use non-standard directories (e.g., `~/.config`)
- Applications with scattered configuration files

## Key Features

### üîç Active Monitoring
Start monitoring before installing an application to capture all file system changes in real-time using macOS FSEvents API.

### üìÅ Non-Standard Path Detection
Tracks files in unconventional locations that other uninstallers miss:
- `~/.config/` (common for cross-platform apps)
- `/tmp/` temporary files
- Custom application directories

### üóëÔ∏è Safe Removal
One-click uninstall with Trash integration:
- Move to Trash by default (recommended for safety)
- Option to delete permanently if preferred
- Real-time progress indicator for large uninstalls
- The application bundle (`/Applications/*.app`)
- Application Support files
- Caches
- Preferences
- Logs
- Configuration files
- All other tracked files

### üìä Detailed Insights
View comprehensive information about monitored applications:
- Total number of files
- Total size
- File categorization by type
- Search and filter capabilities
- Right-click to copy path or reveal in Finder
- Drag-and-drop to start monitoring

## How It Works

1. **Start Monitoring**: Create a monitoring session - type the app name or drag the app from Finder
2. **Install & Use**: Install and briefly use the application while monitoring is active
3. **Stop Monitoring**: Stop the monitoring session to finalize the file list
4. **Review Files**: Browse all detected files categorized by type, right-click for more options
5. **Uninstall**: Choose to move to Trash (recommended) or delete permanently with progress tracking

## Monitored Directories

The tool monitors these key directories:
- `/Applications/`
- `~/Library/Application Support/`
- `~/Library/Caches/`
- `~/Library/Preferences/`
- `~/Library/Logs/`
- `~/Library/WebKit/`
- `~/.config/` *(critical for cross-platform apps)*
- `/tmp/`

## System Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- **Full Disk Access** permission required

## Permissions

This application requires **Full Disk Access** to:
- Monitor protected system directories (`~/Library/*`)
- Delete files from protected locations
- Track all application file changes

### Granting Full Disk Access

1. Open **System Settings** ‚Üí **Privacy & Security** ‚Üí **Full Disk Access**
2. Click the **+** button
3. Navigate to and select **Deep Uninstaller**
4. Enable the toggle switch
5. Restart the application

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- macOS 13.0+ SDK
- Swift 5.9+

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd deep-uninstaller

# Build using Swift Package Manager
swift build -c release

# Or open in Xcode
open Package.swift
```

### Running
```bash
swift run
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **FSEventsMonitor**: Wraps macOS FSEvents API for efficient file system monitoring
- **MonitoringSessionManager**: Manages monitoring sessions and coordinates file tracking
- **StorageManager**: Persists session data to disk using JSON
- **SwiftUI Views**: Modern, native macOS interface

### File Filtering

The monitor automatically filters out system noise:
- `.DS_Store` files
- Spotlight indexes
- Document Revisions
- FSEvents metadata
- Apple system files

## Safety Features

- **Trash by Default**: Files are moved to Trash instead of permanently deleted
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicator shows what's happening
- **Preview Before Delete**: Always shows what will be deleted before execution
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Requires explicit confirmation for uninstall
- **Session Persistence**: Sessions are saved and survive app restarts
- **Sorted Deletion**: Deletes files depth-first to handle nested structures
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Standard macOS shortcuts (‚åòN for new session)

## Limitations

- Only tracks files created **after** monitoring starts
- Cannot track files created by apps that were installed before monitoring
- Requires Full Disk Access for complete functionality
- Some system-protected files may not be deletable

## Use Cases

### Ideal For:
- Testing new applications safely
- Managing Electron applications
- Removing cross-platform apps completely
- Tracking apps with unconventional file structures

### Not Recommended For:
- System applications
- Apps already installed (can't retroactively track)
- Apps requiring frequent reinstallation
