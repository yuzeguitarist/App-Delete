## Tips for Success

- **Use the app after installing** - Creates all config files
- **Descriptive names** - Helps identify sessions later
- **Review before uninstalling** - Double-check file list

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes

- Starting monitoring after installation (too late!)
- Not using the app enough (misses config files)
- Uninstalling while app is running (may fail)
- Forgetting to grant Full Disk Access
