## üéØ Functional Verification

### Scenario 1: Normal Monitoring Flow
- [ ] Start new session ‚Üí Should succeed
- [ ] Monitor detects files ‚Üí Should queue changes
- [ ] Auto-save triggers ‚Üí Should save without errors
- [ ] Stop monitoring ‚Üí Should complete cleanly
- [ ] Session persists ‚Üí Should reload on restart

### Scenario 2: Permission Denied
- [ ] Revoke Full Disk Access
- [ ] Try to start monitoring ‚Üí Should show error alert
- [ ] Error message is clear ‚Üí Should mention permissions
- [ ] Session not created ‚Üí Should not appear in list

### Scenario 3: Race Condition
- [ ] Start monitoring
- [ ] Wait 4 seconds (before auto-save)
- [ ] Click stop immediately
- [ ] No crashes ‚Üí Should complete cleanly
- [ ] Data consistent ‚Üí Should have correct file count

### Scenario 4: Uninstall with Errors
- [ ] Create session with files
- [ ] Make some files read-only
- [ ] Try to uninstall ‚Üí Should partially succeed
- [ ] Error shows all failed files ‚Üí Should list up to 10
- [ ] Success count displayed ‚Üí Should show deleted files

### Scenario 5: Logging Verification
- [ ] Run application
- [ ] Open Console.app
- [ ] Filter: subsystem:com.deepuninstaller.app
- [ ] Perform operations ‚Üí Should see structured logs
- [ ] Check log levels ‚Üí Should be appropriate
