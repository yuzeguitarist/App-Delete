# Pull Request: Fix Robustness, Tests, FSEvents Error Handling, Race Conditions, OS Log, and Unit Tests

## 🎯 Objective
This PR addresses critical robustness issues, adds comprehensive error handling, fixes race conditions, implements proper logging, and establishes a complete unit test suite for the Deep Uninstaller application.

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Silent Monitoring Failure ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Issue**: When FSEvents monitoring failed to start (e.g., due to missing Full Disk Access permissions), the app would silently fail. Users would see "Monitoring" status but no files would be tracked.

**Impact**: Users could install applications thinking they were being tracked, only to discover later that nothing was recorded.

**Fix**:
- Created `FSEventsError` enum with descriptive error cases
- Changed `startMonitoring()` to throw errors
- Added proper resource cleanup on failure
- UI now displays clear error alerts with actionable messages

**Files Changed**:
- `Sources/Services/FSEventsMonitor.swift`
- `Sources/Views/NewSessionSheet.swift`

### 2. Data Race Condition ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Issue**: `saveActiveSession()` (Timer, every 5s) and `stopActiveSession()` (user action) could both access `activeSession` and `fileChangeQueue` simultaneously, causing data races and potential crashes.

**Impact**: Could lead to data corruption, missed file saves, or app crashes when stopping monitoring.

**Fix**:
- Introduced serial `syncQueue` to protect shared state
- All file change queue access now synchronized
- `stopActiveSession()` waits for pending saves to complete
- Proper main thread dispatching for UI updates

**Files Changed**:
- `Sources/Services/MonitoringSessionManager.swift`

### 3. Incomplete Error Reporting ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Issue**: When uninstalling an app with multiple file deletion failures, only the last error was reported. Users couldn't see which files failed or why.

**Impact**: Difficult to diagnose uninstall issues, especially with permission problems.

**Fix**:
- Created `UninstallError` struct that collects ALL failed deletions
- Shows up to 10 failed files with full paths and error messages
- Reports success count even when some deletions fail
- Detailed error presentation in UI

**Files Changed**:
- `Sources/Services/MonitoringSessionManager.swift`
- `Sources/Views/SessionDetailView.swift`

## 📝 Logging Improvements

**Before**: Used `print()` statements
- Don't persist in production
- Can't be filtered or searched
- No severity levels
- Not accessible via Console.app

**After**: Implemented `os.log` framework
- Structured logging with subsystem: `com.deepuninstaller.app`
- Component categories: FSEventsMonitor, MonitoringSessionManager, StorageManager
- Appropriate log levels: `.info`, `.debug`, `.error`, `.warning`
- Searchable in Console.app
- Persists across app restarts

**Files Changed**:
- `Sources/Services/FSEventsMonitor.swift`
- `Sources/Services/MonitoringSessionManager.swift`
- `Sources/Services/StorageManager.swift`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Error Handling Pattern
```swift
enum FSEventsError: Error, LocalizedError {
    case failedToCreateStream
    case failedToStartStream
    case alreadyMonitoring
    
    var errorDescription: String? { /* user-friendly messages */ }
}
```

### Thread Safety Pattern
```swift
private let syncQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "...", qos: .userInitiated)

func handleFileChange() {
    syncQueue.async { [weak self] in
        // Protected access to shared state
    }
}
```

### Logging Pattern
```swift
private let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.deepuninstaller.app", category: "ComponentName")

logger.info("Operation started")
logger.error("Operation failed: \(error)")
```
